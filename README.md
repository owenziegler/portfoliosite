# What *is* this project?
This website is intended to serve as a portfolio for my programming, electrical engineering, and game design projects. In addition to documenting my other projects, it is a project in itself, demonstrating my capabilities as a full-stack programmer.

# What is the scope of this website?
My current plans are to implement a page for my resume, a page for my programming projects, a page for my electrical engineering projects, and a page for my game design projects. Each of the project pages will be formatted like a blog, the posts for which will be contained in the MongoDB database. In the future, I may implment a system for users to create an account on the site and leave comments on the portfolio posts, but that's further down on the priority list.

# What is the architecture of this site?
This website is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Looking at the scope of this website, one might think that this architecture is overkill for my purposes. This may be true, but because this website is a portfolio project in itself, not just a container, I am using it as an opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge of a commonly used architecture.

# Who are you?
My name is Owen Ziegler. I am studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Texas State University, and will graduate in December of 2025, and I have not yet accepted an internship for the summer of 2025. If you are a hiring manager and are impressed with my work either within the portfolio or with the website itself, my contact information is both in my GitHub profile and on the website.
